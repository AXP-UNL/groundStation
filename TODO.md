# We probably want a state for "parked" and a state for "moving"
 * Implement this with a switch
 * When parked, use the IMU to determine the exact orientation of the ground
 * When moving assume that the plate is flat and ignore which way is down
 * Maybe for fun... If we see that there is a "potential crash" and send message to website to alert 

# Get xbees working with SPI and communicate



# Get Raspi W taking pics and ready to communicate
